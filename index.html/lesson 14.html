    <title>THE ANIMATION IN CSS</title>

    <h1>THE ANIMATION IN CSS</h1>
    <p>
      <small>Animation</small> refers to the process of gradually changing an
      element's style over a specified duration, creating visual effects such as
      movement, fading, or transitioning between different states.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS <small>animations</small> is used to enhance user interfaces without
      relying on Javascript, by simply using stylesheets to define keyframes and
      animation properties.
    </p>

    <h2><u>COMPONENTS OF ANIMATION IN CSS</u></h2>
    <p>
      Animations consist of several key components that work together to define
      and control the behaviour of animated element.
    </p>
    <h2>1. <u>ANIMATION PROPERTIES</u></h2>
    <p>
      Animation properties are used to control the behaviour and apperance of
      animations applied to elements. These properties define aspects of the
      animation.

          The <small>animation-name</small> property is used to specify the name

          sequence for an animation. This property is essential for associating
          an element with a specification animation sequence defined elsewhere
          in the stylesheet.

    <h2>2. <u>KEYFRAMES (@keyframes)</u></h2>
    <p>A <small>keyframe</small> is a crucial consept that defines specific stages (or key points) of an animation sequence. keyframes specify the styles that an element should have at certain points during the animation's duration.</p>
    <h3><u>Syntax and Usage:</u></h3>
    <p>Keyframes are defined using the <small>@keyframes</small>, followed by a name that identifies the animation sequence. Inside the <small>@keyframes</small> rule, various keyframe selectors and the corresponding CSS styles.</p>
    <h3><u>Keyframe Selectors:</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>From (equivalent to 0%)
            <ul>
                <li>Represents the starting point of the animation.</li>
                <li>Defines the styles that should be applied to the element at the beginning of the animation</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> To (equivalent to 100%)
            <ul>
                <li>Represents the ending point of the animation</li>
                <li>Defines the styles that should be applied to the element at the end of the animation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Percentage Values (0%, 50%, 100%,, etc)
            <ul>
                <li>Represents specific points in time during the animation's duration.</li>
                <li>Allows for more precise control over intermediate states and transitions within the animation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3><u>Key Points on Keyframes</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Keyframes define the key stages or points of an animation, It specifies how an element should appear and behave at different times during the animation's timeline.</li>
        <li>By Utilizing keyframes and interpolation between them. It creates fluid and dynamic animations that smoothly transition between different states and properties of element.</li>
        <li>Keyframe animation provide powerful capabilities for web developers to enhance user interfaces with engaging and interactive visual effects.</li>
