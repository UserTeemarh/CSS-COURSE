    <h3>Which Color Code is the Best to use?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When <b>named color</b> is used. The use of different shades of colors
        is limited because the browser recognized only 147 predefined colors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hexadecimal colors are very dynamic because it doesn't have a
        limitation. With <small>hex</small> colors, various shades of color can
        be used.
      </li>
      <li>
        RGB colors are as dynamic as hex colors. Apart from being able to
        specify how much red, green, and blue to be used from 0 to 255, the
        transparency of the color can be set with the extra alpha value.
      </li>
      <li>
        HSL is the most dynamic of all. Colors can be specified in degrees from
        0 to 360 within the color wheel, set how saturated and dark it should
        look in percentages, and can also set an opacity from 0.0 to 1.0
