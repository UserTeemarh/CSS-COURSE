    <p>
      The <small>position</small> property is used to specify how an element is
      positioned within its parent element or the viewport. It is used to
      determine where an element is displayed on the page.

        <td>
          The <small>static</small> value is the default positioning method for
          elements. It makes an element follow the normal flow of the document
          and it appears in the order it's written in the HTML and doesn't
          undergo any special positioning behavior.

        <tr>
          <th>relative</th>
          <td>
            The <small>relative</small> value makes the element positioned to
            its normal position in the document flow, but the element can be
            adjusted by using relative properties

        <td>
          The <small>top</small> property specifies the distance the element is
          moved down from its normal position in the document flow. It makes the
          element remains in the document flow, and its position is adjusted
          relative to where it would be normally be placed.

            The <small>left</small> property specifies the distance the element
            is moved horizontally from its normal position in the document. This
            allows the element to be adjusted horizontally to where it would be
            normally be placed

            The <small>bottom</small> property specifies the distance the
            elemetn is moved up from its normal position in the document flow.
            This allows the element's vertical position to be adjusted relative
            to where it would normally be placed.

            The <small>absolute</small> value is used to remove element from the
            normal document flow and position it relative to its nearest
            positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block if no
            positioned ancestor is found). This implies that the element is
            taken out of the flow of the document, and its position is
            calculated based on its closest ancestor with position value

            position. It behaves like relative positioning until the element

    <p><small>z-index</small> property is crucial to positioning property because its the type of property that controls the order of positioned elements that overlap within the same stacking context.</p>
    <h3><u>How It Works:</u></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Elements with higher <small>z-index</small> value are stacked in front of elements with lower <small>z-index</small> values within the stacking context.</li>
      <li>If two elements have the <small>z-index</small>, the one that comes later in the HTML document order will appear on top.</li>
      <li>The <small>z-index</small> property only works on elements with a position value of <small>absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky</small>, It has no effect on elements with <small>static</small> value (the default value). </li>
    </ul>
