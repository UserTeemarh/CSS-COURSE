        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
        <p>CSS is a simple design language intended to transform the presentation of a webpages as well as many non-web environment.</p>
        <h2 class="rules">Rules and Conventions of CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS is a rule-based language — the rule can be defined by the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on a webpage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML element to be styled has to be selected by its name.</li>
            <li>Then a curly braces <small> { }</small> has to set</li>
            <li>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of <b>property</b> and <b>value</b> pairs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>COMPONENTS OF CSS:</h2>
        <h3><u>Application of CSS to HTML</u></h3>
        <p>There are three methods of applying CSS to HTML document: with an <b>external stylesheet,</b> with an <b>internal stylesheet,</b> and <b>inline stylesheet</b>.</p>
        <p><b>EXTERNAL STYLESHEET:</b></p>
        <p> An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage.</p>
        <p><i>External style sheets have the following advantages over internal and inline styles:</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>One change to the style sheet will change all linked pages</li>
            <li>Multiple classes can be created and used on many HTML elements </li>
            <li>Consistent look and fe el across multiple web pages</li>
            <li>Improved load times because the css file is downloaded once and applied to each relevant page as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>INTERNAL STYLESHEET:</b></p>
        <p>The internal style sheet is used to add a unique style for a single document. It is defined in &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML page inside the &lt;style&gt; tag. The rules only apply to that page, but the CSS <b>classes</b> and <b>IDs</b> can be configured  to style multiple elements in the page code.</p>
        <p><b>INLINE STYLESHEET</b></p>
        <p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. An inline CSS uses the <i>style</i> attribute of an HTML element.</p>
        <p>It has the interactive and unique style to create a single HTML element;</p>
        <h3><u>SELECTORS</u></h3>
        <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>
        <p>Selectors are used to target the HTML elements to be styled on webpages. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style</p>
        <h3><u>CSS PROPERTY</u></h3>
        <p>A CSS property is a characteristic whose associated value defines one aspect of how the browser should display the element.</p>
        <h3><u>CSS VALUE</u></h3>
        <p>CSS values are set against CSS Properties and reside within CSS declaration block, which is a part of the CSS rule/statement.</p>
