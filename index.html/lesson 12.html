    <h1>TRANSFORM PROPERTY</h1>
    <p>
      The <small>transform</small> property is used to apply transformations to
      elements. The <small>transform</small> property is used to modify the
      apperance and position of an element without affecting the layout of the
      document.
    </p>
    <p><i>All transform values are to be specified in number.</i></p>
