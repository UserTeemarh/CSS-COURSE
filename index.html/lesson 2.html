      A <small>css selector</small> is a pattern or expression that specifies
      which HTML elements should be selected and styled on a webpage. It allows
      specific elements to be targeted or groups of elements to apply styles.

      rules are applied in a specific order, affecting the appearance of
      elements on the page.
