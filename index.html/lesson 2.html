    <h1><center>CSS SELECTOR</center></h1>
    <p>
      A <small>css selector</small> is a pattern or expression that specifies
      which HTML elements should be selected and styled on a webpage. It allows
      specific elements to be targeted or groups of elements to apply styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS selectors play a key role in the cascading nature of styles, where
      rules are applied in a specific order, affecting the appearance of
      elements on the page.
    </p>
