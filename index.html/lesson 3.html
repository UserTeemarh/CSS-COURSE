    <p>
      Pseudo Selector is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special
      state of the selected element(s). It is used to add styles to selectors,
      but only when those selectors meet certain conditions.
    </p>
    <h2><i>TYPES OF PSEUDO SELECTOR</i></h2>
    <h3>Pseudo-class Selectors</h3>

    <h3><i>Pseudo-element Selectors</i></h3>
    <p>A pseudo-element selector is used to style a specific part of an element's content. Unlike <i>pseudo-class</i>, which targets states of elements or relationships between element, <i>pseudo-element</i> targets parts of elements themselves. Pseudo-elements are preceded by a double colon ": :"</p>
