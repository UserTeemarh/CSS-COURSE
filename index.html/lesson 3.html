    <p>
      Pseudo Selector is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special
      state of the selected element(s). It is used to add styles to selectors,
      but only when those selectors meet certain conditions.

    <h2><i>TYPES OF PSEUDO SELECTOR</i></h2>
    <h3>Pseudo-class Selectors</h3>
    <p>A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector.</p>
